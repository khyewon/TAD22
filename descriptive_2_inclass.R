# Descriptive practice


#1. Write two sentences. Save each as a seperate object in R. 

require(quanteda)

#2. Combine them into a corpus


#3. Make this corpus into a dfm with all pre-processing options at their defaults.


#4. Now save a second dfm, this time with stopwords removed.


#5. Calculate the TTR for each of these dfms (use textstat_lexdiv). Which is higher?
  

#6. Calculate the Manhattan distance between the two sentences you've constructed (by hand!)
